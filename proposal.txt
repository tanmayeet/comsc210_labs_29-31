Project Overview:
My project creates a solar system simulation designed to predict how celestial bodies move and evolve over the next 50 million years. It illustrates how  

Implementation: 
I will use an std :: map to store and manage data related to different celestial bodies across different solar system zones. This map will categorize celestial bodies into three std::lists representing stars, planets, and black holes. 
The map will have the solar system zone name as its key and the map's value will be an array of these three lists. The three I chose for this simulation are the inner solar system, the outer solar system, and the Kuiper Belt.

Simulated events: This simulation will focus on three different events: 
1. Orbital shifts 
2. Compositional changes of the planets
3. Astronomical interactions
