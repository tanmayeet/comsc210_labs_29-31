// Include necesssary headers for file handling, data structures, etc.

// Define a function to simulate astronomical changes over time

// Parameters: map of solar system zones, number of time intervals

// Define main function
// Initialize a mpa to store solar system zone info, each associoated with an
// array of lists for planets, stars, and black holes

// Open an external file to read data about solar system zones and to populate
// the map If file does not open, print an error and exit

// Read data from the file and populate the map
// For each line, extract solar system zone and celestial body data
// Each line contains zone, category, and event

// Insert celestial bodies into the appropriate list in the array for their
// solar system zone

// Close the file

// Begin a time-based simulation for astronmical changes
